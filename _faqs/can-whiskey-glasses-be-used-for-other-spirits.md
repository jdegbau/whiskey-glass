Whiskey glasses, especially those with wide rims like the Glencairn or the tumbler, are versatile enough to serve other spirits like rum, tequila, or even brandy. Their broad surface area allows the drink to breathe, which enhances the aromas, making them suitable for sipping spirits. However, certain glasses, like the tulip-shaped ones used for whiskey, may not be ideal for every spirit.

For example, spirits like gin or vodka, which are often enjoyed chilled or mixed, might not benefit as much from the wide mouth of a whiskey glass. A highball or a cocktail glass could be more appropriate for these. Nevertheless, for aged and aromatic spirits, using a whiskey glass can still elevate the tasting experience, emphasizing the complex flavors and aromas in much the same way as it does for whiskey.
