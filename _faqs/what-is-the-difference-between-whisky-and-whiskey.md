title: What is the difference between whisky and whiskey?
category: General
quick_answer: The difference between "whiskey" and "whisky" primarily comes down to geographic spelling conventions. In the United States and Ireland, the spirit is typically spelled with an "e" as "whiskey." Meanwhile, in Scotland, Canada, and Japan, it’s spelled without the "e," as "whisky."

Although the spelling differs, there’s no fundamental distinction in the production process based on the name alone. However, the regional differences in whiskey-making techniques and traditions do lead to distinct styles. For instance, Scotch whisky, often simply called "Scotch," is made primarily from malted barley and is usually distilled twice, often with a smoky flavor due to the use of peat in the malting process. In contrast, Irish whiskey is typically triple-distilled, giving it a smoother, lighter taste profile.

In the US, "whiskey" often refers to Bourbon or Rye, both of which have unique mash bills and aging processes that contribute to their flavors. The "whisky" from Canada, often called Canadian whisky or "rye whisky," is generally smoother and lighter, while Japan’s whisky is heavily influenced by Scotch-making traditions, but with its own distinct nuances.

Though the spelling variations may seem minor, they reflect the rich history and heritage of whiskey-making in different regions, with each producing its own unique styles and flavors.
