A tulip-shaped glass or a Glencairn glass is widely recommended because of their specific design features, which promote a better sensory experience.

The tulip-shaped glass, often referred to as a nosing glass, has a wide bowl that tapers toward the top. This design allows the whiskey to breathe, while the narrow rim helps concentrate the aromas, making it easier to identify the subtle notes that define a whiskey’s character. The shape also encourages swirling, which releases the complex aromas for nosing before sipping.

The Glencairn glass, designed specifically for whiskey tasting, is another popular choice among enthusiasts and professionals alike. It has a similar shape to the tulip glass but is slightly smaller and more robust, offering a comfortable grip. The wide bowl allows you to appreciate the whiskey's color, while the narrow neck traps and funnels the aromas toward your nose, enhancing the overall tasting experience.

Both of these glasses are ideal for sipping whiskey neat or with a few drops of water. While traditional tumblers (also called rocks glasses) are more commonly used for casual whiskey drinking, especially with ice, the tulip or Glencairn glass is the preferred choice for those wanting to explore the full complexity of whiskey’s flavors.
